### Legend

- ‚úÖ **Complete**: Feature is implemented
- ‚è≥ **In Progress/Planned**: Feature is being worked on
- ‚òê **Not Started**: Feature has not been started yet
- N/A: Not applicable (feature was implemented directly in WCT)

## Current State (v0.0.1)

We are in the process of transforming from proof-of-concept to a production-ready framework with the following:

### Features Implemented & Planned

**Core Architecture**
- **Schema-driven design**: Strongly typed schema system with unified interface, dependency injection, and runtime validation
- **Modular connector/analyser architecture**: Hot-swappable components with clear interfaces
- **Rulesets system**: Comprehensive rule definitions for personal data and processing purposes
- **Message-based validation**: Automatic input/output validation using JSON schemas

**Data Analysis Capabilities**
- **Personal data detection**: Multi-source personal data identification (MySQL, PHP, files)
- **Processing purpose analysis**: GDPR-compliant processing purpose detection
- **Log analysis**: Application and server log compliance analysis
