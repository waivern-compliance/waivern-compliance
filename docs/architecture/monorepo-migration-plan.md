## Vision

Transform single package into multi-package framework:

```
waivern-core         → Base abstractions (BaseConnector, Analyser, Message, Schema)
waivern-llm          → Multi-provider LLM service (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google)
waivern-community    → All built-in connectors/analysers/rulesets
waivern-*            → Individual packages (optional, e.g., waivern-mysql)
wct                  → CLI tool application
```

**Inspired by:** LangChain's proven monorepo pattern (`langchain-core`, `langchain-community`, `langchain-openai`, `langchain`)

---

## Completed Work

See **[monorepo-migration-completed.md](./monorepo-migration-completed.md)** for full details.

**Summary of completed phases:**
- ✅ UV workspace with 4 packages (waivern-core, waivern-llm, waivern-community, wct)
- ✅ Package-centric quality checks architecture
- ✅ Framework independence (waivern-core and waivern-llm have zero WCT dependencies)
- ✅ Multi-provider LLM abstraction with lazy imports (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google)
- ✅ All built-in components extracted to waivern-community package
- ✅ Component-owned schema architecture following "components own their data contracts"
- ✅ App-specific configuration architecture (`.env` in apps/wct/)
- ✅ Proper test isolation with fixture-based registry management
- ✅ 738 tests passing, all quality checks passing

---

## Phase 2: Extract waivern-llm (COMPLETE)

**Goal:** Move LLM service to standalone package

**Completed:**
- ✅ Created `libs/waivern-llm/` package with focused module structure
- ✅ Split monolithic `llm_service.py` (534 lines) into 6 focused modules
- ✅ Moved 93 tests from `apps/wct/tests/llm_service/` to `libs/waivern-llm/tests/`
- ✅ Updated all imports across codebase (`wct.llm_service` → `waivern_llm`)
- ✅ Configured workspace and added waivern-llm dependency to wct
- ✅ Updated pre-commit hooks for waivern-llm package
- ✅ Moved `.env` to app-specific location (`apps/wct/.env`)
- ✅ Created comprehensive configuration documentation
- ✅ All 749 tests passing (including 12 integration tests with real APIs)

**Additional work completed:**
- **Configuration architecture refactor:** Moved environment configuration from workspace root to application directory following 12-factor app principles
- **Documentation:** Created `docs/configuration.md` with comprehensive configuration guide
- **VS Code integration:** Updated `.vscode/settings.json` with correct schema and .env paths

**Tasks (Reference):**

### 2.1: Create Package Structure

```bash
mkdir -p libs/waivern-llm/src/waivern_llm
mkdir -p libs/waivern-llm/tests
mkdir -p libs/waivern-llm/scripts
```

### 2.2: Create pyproject.toml

```toml
[project]
name = "waivern-llm"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Multi-provider LLM abstraction for Waivern Compliance Framework"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.12"
dependencies = [
    "waivern-core",
    "langchain>=0.3.0",
    "langchain-anthropic>=0.2.0",
]

[dependency-groups]
dev = [
    "basedpyright>=1.29.2",
    "ruff>=0.11.12",
]
openai = ["langchain-openai>=0.2.0"]
google = ["langchain-google-genai>=2.0.0"]
all = ["waivern-llm[openai,google]"]

[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
packages = ["src/waivern_llm"]

[tool.basedpyright]
include = ["src"]

[tool.ruff]
target-version = "py312"
src = ["src"]
```

### 2.3: Split llm_service.py into Modules

```
libs/waivern-llm/src/waivern_llm/
├── __init__.py          # Public exports
├── errors.py            # LLM exceptions
├── base.py              # BaseLLMService ABC
├── anthropic.py         # AnthropicLLMService
├── openai.py            # OpenAILLMService
├── google.py            # GoogleLLMService
└── factory.py           # LLMServiceFactory
```

### 2.4: Move Tests

```bash
# Move tests to waivern-llm package
mv apps/wct/tests/llm_service/* libs/waivern-llm/tests/waivern_llm/
```

Update test imports: `from wct.llm_service import ...` → `from waivern_llm import ...`

### 2.5: Update Imports Across Codebase

Find and update all imports:
```python
# Before
from wct.llm_service import BaseLLMService, LLMServiceFactory

# After
from waivern_llm import BaseLLMService, LLMServiceFactory
```

### 2.6: Create Package Scripts

Create `libs/waivern-llm/scripts/{lint.sh,format.sh,type-check.sh}` following the pattern from waivern-core.

### 2.7: Update Workspace Configuration

Add to root `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[tool.uv.workspace]
members = [
    "libs/waivern-core",
    "libs/waivern-llm",    # Add this
    "apps/wct",
]
```

Add to `apps/wct/pyproject.toml`:
```toml
dependencies = [
    "waivern-core",
    "waivern-llm",         # Add this
    ...
]
```

### 2.8: Update Pre-commit Wrappers

Update `scripts/pre-commit-{format,lint,type-check}.sh` to include waivern-llm package.

### 2.9: Verification

```bash
uv sync
uv run pytest libs/waivern-llm/tests/
uv run pytest apps/wct/tests/
uv run pytest -m integration  # LLM integration tests
./scripts/dev-checks.sh
```

### 2.10: Commit

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "refactor: extract waivern-llm as standalone package

Move LLM service abstraction to separate waivern-llm package with
multi-provider support (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google).

Changes:
- Create libs/waivern-llm/ package
- Split llm_service.py into focused modules
- Move tests to waivern-llm package
- Update imports across codebase
- Add waivern-llm to workspace members

Test results:
- All unit tests pass
- All integration tests pass
- Type checking passes
- Linting passes

Breaking changes: None (import paths updated)"
```

---

## Phase 3: Create waivern-community (COMPLETE)

**Goal:** Move all built-in connectors/analysers/rulesets to community package and establish clean schema architecture
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Duration:** 4-6 hours
**Commits:** `75df22c`, `78b886d`, `9ae22dc`, `9d79217`

See **[monorepo-migration-completed.md](./monorepo-migration-completed.md#phase-3-create-waivern-community-package-completed)** for full implementation details, schema architecture decisions, and commit messages.

---

## Phase 4: Individual Packages (Optional)

**When needed:**
- User wants minimal dependencies
- Component becomes popular standalone
- Third party wants to maintain separately

**Example:** Extract `waivern-mysql` from `waivern-community`

**Note:** No backward compatibility needed - this is a full refactoring where import paths will be updated directly.

---

## Phase 5: Dynamic Plugin Loading

**Goal:** Implement plugin system in WCT executor

**Key features:**
- Load components from waivern-community (default)
- Load from standalone packages (`package:waivern-mysql`)
- Extensible for remote components (future)

**Runbook example:**
```yaml
connectors:
  - name: "db"
    type: "mysql"
    source: "community"  # Optional, default
    properties: {...}

  - name: "custom"
    type: "custom_db"
    source: "package:acme-custom-connector"
    properties: {...}
```

---

## Phase 6: Contribution Infrastructure

**Goal:** Documentation and tooling for third-party contributors

**Deliverables:**
- `docs/contributing/create-connector.md`
- `docs/contributing/create-analyser.md`
- `docs/examples/` with working templates
- `scripts/publish-packages.sh`
- Updated README with ecosystem overview
