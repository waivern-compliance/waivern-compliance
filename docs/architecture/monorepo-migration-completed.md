# Waivern Compliance Framework - Monorepo Migration Completed Phases

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Total Time:** 11-13 hours
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-15

This document records the completed phases of the monorepo migration. See [monorepo-migration-plan.md](./monorepo-migration-plan.md) for the full migration plan and remaining work.

---

## Pre-Phase 1: Architectural Cleanup (COMPLETED)

**Goal:** Prepare codebase for monorepo migration by ensuring clean package independence
**Duration:** 3-4 hours
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Risk:** Low (all tests passing, zero breaking changes)

### What Was Done

**Background:** Before implementing the full monorepo structure, we needed to ensure the codebase had proper architectural separation between framework and application layers. This work focused on package independence and removing WCT-specific dependencies from framework-level code.

### Completed Work

**1. Made JsonSchemaLoader Configurable (Commit 68079ba)**
- **Problem:** `JsonSchemaLoader` was hardcoded to WCT-specific paths, making it impossible to reuse in other applications
- **Solution:** Added configurable search paths via `__init__(search_paths: list[Path] | None = None)`
- **Impact:** Framework-level loader can now be used by any application with custom schema locations
- **Files Changed:**
  - `libs/waivern-core/src/waivern_core/schemas/base.py`
- **Tests:** All 737 tests pass

**2. Moved BaseFindingSchema to WCT Layer (Commit cac9df8)**
- **Problem:** `BaseFindingSchema` was in waivern-core but is a WCT-specific concept (compliance "findings")
- **Solution:** Moved to `src/wct/schemas/base.py` where it belongs as an application-level abstraction
- **Impact:** Framework no longer has application-specific schema concepts
- **Files Changed:**
  - Created: `src/wct/schemas/base.py` with `BaseFindingSchema`
  - Updated: All WCT schema imports to use new location
- **Tests:** All 737 tests pass

**3. Moved Analyser + Errors to waivern-core (Commit 1de9b1e)**
- **Problem:** Base `Analyser` class was in WCT but needed to be framework-level for reusability
- **Solution:** Moved `Analyser`, `AnalyserError`, `AnalyserInputError`, `AnalyserProcessingError` to waivern-core
- **Key Design Decision:** Framework method `update_analyses_chain()` returns `list[dict[str, Any]]` (untyped) whilst WCT converts to `AnalysisChainEntry` (typed Pydantic models) - this maintains framework independence
- **Files Changed:**
  - Created: `libs/waivern-core/src/waivern_core/base_analyser.py`
  - Deleted: `src/wct/analysers/base.py` (re-export file removed per user request)
  - Updated: All imports to use `from waivern_core import Analyser` directly
- **Tests:** All 737 tests pass

**4. Removed Orphaned BaseFindingSchema (Commit bc3864e)**
- **Problem:** After Phase 2, the original `BaseFindingSchema` was accidentally left in waivern-core
- **Solution:** Deleted the orphaned class and removed from exports
- **Impact:** Clean separation - `BaseFindingSchema` only exists in WCT layer where it belongs
- **Files Changed:**
  - `libs/waivern-core/src/waivern_core/schemas/base.py` (deleted lines 212-239)
  - `libs/waivern-core/src/waivern_core/schemas/__init__.py` (removed from exports)
- **Tests:** All 737 tests pass

### Current State After Pre-Phase 1

**✅ Completed:**
- `libs/waivern-core/` package exists with proper architectural boundaries
- Framework classes properly separated from application classes
- Zero WCT-specific dependencies in waivern-core
- All 737 tests passing
- All type checking passing (basedpyright strict)
- All linting passing (ruff)

### Key Learnings

1. **Framework Independence Pattern Works:** The dict-to-typed-object pattern (framework returns dicts, application converts to Pydantic models) successfully maintains clean separation
2. **Re-export Elimination:** User specifically requested no re-export layers - all imports should be direct from source package
3. **Test Coverage Excellent:** 737 passing tests caught all issues during refactoring
4. **Zero Breaking Changes:** All architectural work completed with no external API changes

---

## Phase 0: Pre-work (COMPLETED)

**Goal:** Ensure clean starting point
**Duration:** 1 hour
**Prerequisites:** Feature 9 complete, all tests passing
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Tasks

1. ✅ Merge all pending PRs (Features 1-9)
2. ✅ Run full test suite: `uv run pytest` (all pass)
3. ✅ Run integration tests: `uv run pytest -m integration` (all pass)
4. ✅ Run dev checks: `./scripts/dev-checks.sh` (all pass)
5. ✅ Create migration branch: `git checkout -b refactor/monorepo-migration`
6. ✅ Document current import structure

---

## Phase 1: Workspace Setup + waivern-core (COMPLETED)

**Goal:** Create `uv` workspace structure and formalise waivern-core package
**Duration:** 2-3 hours
**Risk:** Low (no behaviour change)
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### 1.1: Create Workspace Structure

**Actions:**

1. Created directory structure:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p libs/waivern-core/src/waivern_core
   mkdir -p libs/waivern-core/tests/waivern_core
   mkdir -p apps/wct/src/wct
   mkdir -p apps/wct/tests
   ```

2. Updated root `pyproject.toml` with workspace configuration:
   ```toml
   [tool.uv.workspace]
   members = [
       "libs/waivern-core",
       "apps/wct",
   ]
   ```

3. Created `libs/waivern-core/pyproject.toml` and `apps/wct/pyproject.toml` with proper metadata

### 1.2: Verification

All verification checks passed:
- ✅ Workspace packages installed: `uv sync`
- ✅ All tests pass: `uv run pytest` (737 tests)
- ✅ Type checking passes: basedpyright strict mode
- ✅ Linting passes: ruff

### 1.3: Commit Phase 1

**Commit:** `714a137` - refactor: complete Phase 1 monorepo migration to UV workspace

---

## Phase 1.6: Package-Centric Quality Checks Architecture (COMPLETED)

**Goal:** Implement package-centric quality checks following monorepo best practices
**Duration:** 4-5 hours
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Commit:** `7d05ee7`

After the workspace structure was created, we implemented a proper package-centric quality checks architecture following industry best practices (LangChain, boto3, airflow, pallets pattern).

### Problems Solved

1. Inconsistency between dev-checks and pre-commit behaviour
2. Workspace-level tool configs coupling packages together
3. Inability to check packages independently
4. Mixed workspace/package concerns

### Implementation

**1. Package Ownership**
- Moved all tool configs (basedpyright, ruff) from root to package `pyproject.toml` files
- Added dev dependency groups to both packages (`basedpyright>=1.29.2`, `ruff>=0.11.12`)
- Removed F401 blanket ignore for `__init__.py` (now requires explicit patterns)

**2. Package Scripts**
- Created `apps/wct/scripts/` directory with `lint.sh`, `format.sh`, `type-check.sh`
- Created `libs/waivern-core/scripts/` directory with `lint.sh`, `format.sh`, `type-check.sh`
- Scripts run from package directory using package's own configuration
- Type checking targets `src/` directory by default (excludes tests)

**3. Root Orchestration**
- Updated root scripts to call package scripts in sequence
- Created pre-commit wrappers that group files by package: `scripts/pre-commit-{lint,format,type-check}.sh`
- Updated `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to use package-aware wrappers
- Fixed `dev-checks.sh` to use orchestration script instead of direct ruff call
- Fixed `init.sh` to include `--all-packages` flag

### Benefits

- ✅ Package independence - each package can be checked in isolation
- ✅ Consistent behaviour - dev-checks and pre-commit use same configs
- ✅ Standard pattern - follows monorepo best practices
- ✅ Clean separation - workspace doesn't know package internals

### Usage

```bash
# Workspace-level (checks all packages)
./scripts/lint.sh
./scripts/format.sh
./scripts/type-check.sh
./scripts/dev-checks.sh  # All checks + tests

# Package-level (check individual packages)
cd apps/wct && ./scripts/lint.sh
cd libs/waivern-core && ./scripts/type-check.sh
```

### Test Results

- ✅ 737 tests passing
- ✅ Type checking: 0 errors (src/ only)
- ✅ Linting: All checks passed
- ✅ Formatting: 173 files checked
- ✅ All pre-commit hooks passing

### Commit Message

```
refactor: implement package-centric quality checks architecture

Restructure quality tooling to follow monorepo best practices where each
package owns its complete tool configuration and can be checked independently.

**Package Ownership:**
- Move basedpyright and ruff configs from root to package pyproject.toml files
- Add dev dependency groups (basedpyright, ruff) to both packages
- Remove F401 blanket ignore for __init__.py (use explicit patterns instead)

**Package Scripts:**
- Create scripts/ directory in each package with lint.sh, format.sh, type-check.sh
- Scripts run from package directory using package's own configuration
- Type checking targets src/ directory by default (excludes tests)

**Orchestration:**
- Update root scripts to call package scripts in sequence
- Create pre-commit wrappers that group files by package and run appropriate checks
- Update .pre-commit-config.yaml to use package-aware wrappers

**Fixes:**
- Fix dev-checks.sh to use orchestration script instead of direct ruff call
- Fix init.sh to include --all-packages flag in sync command
- Fix RulesetError import in wct/rulesets/__init__.py

This enables independent package checking whilst maintaining workspace-level
orchestration for convenience. Resolves inconsistency between dev-checks and
pre-commit behaviour.
```
