"""Tests for ServiceContainer - DI container core functionality.

These tests verify the service container's ability to:
- Register services with different lifetimes (singleton, transient)
- Lazy-load services on first access
- Cache singleton instances
- Create new transient instances per request
- Handle errors gracefully (missing services, creation failures)
- Support type safety
