## Migration Analysis Summary

Based on my comprehensive analysis, your WCT migration is approximately 65% complete. Here are the key findings:

### ‚úÖ Successfully Migrated

- Core orchestration architecture (superior to legacy)
- CLI interface with enhanced logging controls
- Configuration loading and validation
- Basic plugin and connector framework

### ‚ùå Critical Missing Functionality

1. Plugin Discovery System
- Legacy uses automatic entry point discovery (waivern-plugins)
- WCT requires manual registration - orchestrator starts with empty registries

2. Data Processing Model
- Legacy: Iterator-based streaming (Connection.iter_findings())
- WCT: Simple dictionary exchange (less memory efficient)

3. Source Abstraction
- Legacy: Sources ‚Üí Connectors ‚Üí Rulesets (three-stage pipeline)
- WCT: Direct connector ‚Üí plugin (missing source layer)

4. WordPress Connector
- Legacy has full WordPress project detection at src/plugins/wordpress/
- WCT has incomplete WordPress connector stub

5. Plugin Selection/Filtering
- Legacy supports select/exclude plugins in config
- WCT has no runtime plugin filtering mechanism

### üîß Required Migration Work

**High Priority:**

1. Implement entry point discovery system
2. Auto-register built-in connectors/plugins in orchestrator
3. Complete WordPress connector migration
4. Add plugin selection to runbook format

**Medium Priority:**

5. Reintroduce source abstraction for connector composition
6. Implement streaming data processing for large datasets
7. Add structured data schemas (Finding/ReportItem pattern)

The WCT architecture is more modern and maintainable, but lacks the plugin ecosystem infrastructure that makes the legacy system functional for external plugins.
