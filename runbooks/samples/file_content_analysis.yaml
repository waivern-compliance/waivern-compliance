  Analyse file content for sensitive information.
  This is a sample runbook to demonstrate how the system works.
  The connectors and analysers used in this runbook are also illustrative implementations.

connectors:
  - name: "file_content_connector"
    type: "file_reader"

      path: "./tests/wct/connectors/file/sample_file.txt"


analysers:
  - name: "file_content_analyser"
    type: "file_content_analyser"
    properties:
      sensitivity_level: "medium"
    metadata:
      priority: "high"
